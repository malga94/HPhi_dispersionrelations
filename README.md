# HPhi_dispersionrelations
Script to generate dispersion relations using the program HPhi

Make sure you have HPhi installed in the same directory where the script main.sh is located. 
For now the program only works for the chain and ladder lattice. You can specify the parameters (number of sites, exchange interaction, magnetic field along z) in ./PrepareData/next_run.in, following the syntax for the standard mode input file given on P.26 of the HPhi manual

Tested using HPhi version 3.2.0
