# HPhi_dispersionrelations
Script to generate dispersion relations using the program HPhi

Make sure you have HPhi installed in the same directory where the script runhphi.py is located. For now the program only works for the chain lattice. You can specify the parameters (number of sites, exchange interaction, magnetic field along z) by modifying the generate_inputfile.sh bash script.

Tested using HPhi version 3.2.0
